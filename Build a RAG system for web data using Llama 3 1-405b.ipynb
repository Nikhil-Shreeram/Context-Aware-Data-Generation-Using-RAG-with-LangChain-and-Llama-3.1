    "In traditional language generation tasks, LLMs, such as OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or IBM’s Granite Models, are used to construct responses based on an input prompt.

It offers a studio, data store, and governance toolkit. It supports multiple large language models (LLMs) along with IBM\\'s own Granite.[2][1]\\n\\nThe platform is described as an AI tool tailed to companies and a one which can be customized for customers\\' needs and trained on their confidential data, as client data is said to be not collected by IBM for further training of their models. It is also capable of fine-tuning, an approach which makes training pre-trained models on the newly introduced data possible.[3]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nWatsonx was revealed on May 9, 2023, at the annual Think conference of IBM as a platform that includes multiple services. Just like Watson AI computer with the similar name, Watsonx was named after Thomas J. Watson, IBM\\'s founder and first CEO.[1]\\n\\nOn February 13, 2024, Anaconda partnered with IBM to embed its open-source Python packages into Watsonx.[4]\\n\\nWatsonx is currently used at ESPN\\'s Fantasy Football App for managing players\\' performance.[5] It is also used by Italian telecommunications company Wind Tre.[6] Watsonx was used to generate editorial content around nominees during the 66th Annual Grammy Awards.[7]\\n\\nServices\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nwatsonx.ai\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nWatsonx.ai is a platform that allows AI developers to leverage a wide range of LLMs under IBM\\'s own Granite series and others such as Facebook\\'s LLaMA-2, free and open-source model Mistral and many others present in Hugging Face community for a diverse set of AI development tasks.[8][9] These models come pre-trained and are designed to excel in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, encompassing question answering, content generation, summarization, text classification, and data extraction. The platform allows fine-tuning with its Tuning Studio, allowing those models to learn the data provided by customers.[10]\\n\\nwatsonx.data\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nWatsonx.data is a platform designed to assist clients in addressing issues related to data volume, complexity, cost, and governance as they scale their AI workloads. This platform facilitates seamless data access, whether the data is stored in the cloud or on-premises, through a single entry point, offering simple use for users who may not possess technical expertise. This approach prioritizes data security and compliance.[10]\\n\\nwatsonx.governance\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nWatsonx.governance is a platform that utilizes IBM\\'s AI governance capabilities to support organizations in implementing comprehensive AI lifecycle governance. This helps them manage risks and maintain compliance with evolving AI and industry regulations.

(now IBM Cloud) was a dedicated server, managed hosting, and cloud computing provider, founded in 2005 and acquired by IBM in 2013. SoftLayer initially specialized in hosting workloads for gaming companies and startups, but shifted focus to enterprise workloads after its acquisition.[2]\\\\n\\\\nSoftLayer had bare-metal compute offerings before other large cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services.[3]\\\\n\\\\nSoftLayer has hosted workloads for companies such as The Hartford, WhatsApp, Whirlpool, Daimler, and Macy\\\\\\'s.[4]\\\\n\\\\nTimeline\\\\n\\\\n[edit]\\\\n\\\\nYear 2005: SoftLayer was established in 2005 by Lance Crosby and several of his ex-coworkers.[5]\\\\n\\\\nYear 2010 - August: GI Partners acquired a majority equity stake in SoftLayer in August 2010.[6]\\\\n\\\\nYear 2010 - November: In November of that year it merged the company with The Planet Internet Services, SoftLayer\\\\\\'s biggest competitor, and consolidated the customer base under the SoftLayer brand.[7][8]\\\\n\\\\nYear 2011 - Q1: In Q1 2011, the company reported hosting more than 81,000 servers for more than 26,000 customers in locations throughout the United States.[9]\\\\n\\\\nYear 2011 - July: In July 2011, the company announced plans for international expansion to Amsterdam and Singapore to add to the existing network of North American-based data centers in Dallas (Texas), San Jose (California), Seattle (Washington), Houston (Texas) and Washington, D.C.[10] Most of these data centers were leased via Digital Realty.[11]\\\\n\\\\nYear 2013 June 4: On June 4, 2013, IBM announced its acquisition of SoftLayer under undisclosed financial terms, in a deal that according to Reuters could have fetched more than $2 billion,[12] to form an IBM Cloud Services Division.[13][14] At the time of acquisition, SoftLayer was described as the biggest privately held cloud infrastructure provider (IaaS) in the world.[15]\\\\n\\\\nYear 2015 - May: As of May 2015, the company has 23 data centers in 11 different countries.[16]\\\\n\\\\nYear 2018: By 2018, SoftLayer was renamed to IBM Cloud.[17]\\\\n\\\\nInitial launch of Bluemix (2013â\\x80\\x932016)\\\\n\\\\n[edit]\\\\n\\\\nIn June 2013, IBM acquired SoftLayer, a public cloud platform, to serve as the foundation for its IaaS offering. Bluemix was announced for public beta in February 2014[18] after having been developed since early 2013.[19] Bluemix was based on the open source Cloud Foundry project and ran on SoftLayer infrastructure. IBM announced the general availability of the Bluemix Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering in July 2014.[20]\\\\n\\\\nBy April 2015, Bluemix included a suite of over 100 cloud-based development tools \"including social, mobile, security, analytics, database, and IoT (internet of things).[21] Bluemix had grown to 83,000 users in India with growth of approximately 10,000 users each month.[21]\\\\n\\\\nA year after announcement, Bluemix had made little headway in the cloud-computing platform space relative to its competition, and remained substantially behind market leaders Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS.[22] By August 2016, little had changed in market acceptance of the Bluemix offering.[23] In February 2016,[24] IBM Bluemix includes IBM\\\\\\'s Function as a Service (FaaS) system, or Serverless computing offering, that is built using open source[25] from the Apache OpenWhisk incubator project largely credited[26] to IBM for seeding. This system, equivalent to Amazon Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, Oracle Cloud Fn or Google Cloud Functions, allows calling of a specific function in response to an event without requiring any resource management from the developer.[27]\\\\n\\\\nRe-brand to IBM Cloud (since 2017)\\\\n\\\\n[edit]\\\\n\\\\nIn May 2017 IBM released Kubernetes support as the IBM Bluemix Container Service, later renamed to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS).[28] IKS was built using the open source Kubernetes project. This system, equivalent to Amazon Web Services EKS, Microsoft Azure AKS, or Google Cloud GKE, aims to provide a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. In October 2017, IBM announced that they would rebrand their cloud as IBM Cloud brand, merging all components, thus retiring the Bluemix and Softlayer brands.[29] In March 2018, IBM launched an industry first managed Kubernetes service on bare metal.[30] In August 2019, 3 weeks after the close of Red Hat acquisition, IBM launched a managed Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.[31]\\\\n\\\\nIn November 2019, IBM has announced that it had designed the world\\\\\\'s first financial services-ready public cloud and that Bank of America was its first committed collaborator and anchor customer, joined shortly thereafter in 2020 by BNP Paribas as its first European anchor client.[32] IBM announced in April 2021 the general availability of IBM Cloud for Financial Services, including support for Red Hat OpenShift and other cloud-native technologies.[33] In July 2021, it was announced that SAP is onboarding two of its finance and data management solutions to IBM Cloud for Financial Services.[34] In September 2021, it was CaixaBank\\\\\\'s turn to boost digital capabilities with IBM Cloud for Financial Services[35] and onboarding to new IBM Cloud Multizone Region in Spain.[36]\\\\n\\\\nCustomer base\\\\n\\\\n[edit]\\\\n\\\\nIn 2019, IBM partnered with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) to provide new AI-powered tools for the US Open.[37]\\\\n\\\\nIn May 2020, IBM announced agreements with six European companies, including Osram and CrÃ©dit Mutuel, that use IBM Cloud to access advanced technologies such as AI, blockchain and analytics.[38]\\\\n\\\\nReviews\\\\n\\\\n[edit]\\\\n\\\\nIBM Cloud continued to be considered a leader in bare-metal in 2020, and distinguished itself by providing over 11 million possible custom configurations with the latest Power, Intel, and AMD CPUs and Nvidia GPUs.[39]\\\\n\\\\nEnvironmental impact\\\\n\\\\n[edit]\\\\n\\\\nIn 2021, IBM announced it would achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.[40]\\\\n\\\\nReferences\\\\n\\\\n[edit]\\\\n\\\\n^ \"Catalog - IBM Cloud\".

    "Next, we choose an embedding model to be trained on our IBM products dataset. The trained embedding model is used to generate embeddings for each data point in the dataset. For text data, popular open-source embedding models include Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText or pretrained transformer-based models like BERT or RoBERTa. OpenAIembeddings may also be used by leveraging the OpenAI embeddings API endpoint, the `langchain_openai` package and getting an `openai_api_key`, however, there is a cost associated with this usage.\n",
